                      information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g. Google Maps

                      estimate your location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters, while WiFi and cell towers help improve accuracy when GPS signals are weak, 
                      like indoors. This data helps Google Maps provide directions, but it is 
                      not always perfectly precise.

                  <h2>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

                  <p>
                  Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile 
                  applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate 
                  to signal your privacy preference not to have data about Four online browsing 
                  activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology 
                  standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As 
                  such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other 
                  mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked 
                  online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the 
                  future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy 
                  Notice.
